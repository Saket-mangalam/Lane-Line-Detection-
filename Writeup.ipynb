    "**My Pipeline consists of 8 steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Identifying Best Color Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change the color scale of an image file in many ways to best suit our needs. In this project, the color scale had to be chosen to distinguish lane lines from the rest of the image. Converting into grayscale is a common option. However, grayscale image fails to distingusih beetween lane lines and other behavioral features of image like shadows. So other scales to which the RGB image can be converted using OpenCV are HLS, Bayer, YCrCb.jpeg and HSV etc. Since we need png files for video processing HLS conversion turned to be the best scale for segregating white and yellow lane lines from rest of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/hls_image/whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/hls_image/solidYellowLeft.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Applying White Yellow Mask on image\n",
    "\n",
    "Masking an image means selecting the parts of image with the given color threshold and rest all other pixels are turned to 0 or black. This step helps in segregating the lane lines in the colored image itself which will decrease the noise in the later stages of processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/white_yellow/whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/white_yellow/solidYellowLeft.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/white_yellow/solidYellowCurve2.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Grayscale conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Gray Scale version of the pre-processed image looks similar to these images for most part of the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/grayscale_image/whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/grayscale_image/solidYellowLeft.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/grayscale_image/solidYellowCurve2.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Gaussian Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian smoothing kernel is used for smoothing the image so that there is no sudden and discontinuous change in the image which will inturn make canny edge detection tough due to many discontinuities on graph. However, canny operator has its own smoothing kernel of size 3. But still a smoothing kernel gives user the choice to alter the smoothing . A kernel of size (5X5) was used for smoothing. Smoothing which larger kernels decreases gradient change across the area of image which can be harmful and useful depending on the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/Gaussian_smooth_image/whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",

    " <img src=\"test_images_output/Gaussian_smooth_image/solidYellowCurve2.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Canny Edge Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV has predefined function `canny()` for detecting edges in an image based on canny's technique. It makes areas with gradient change in a given threshold be defined as edge by thinning to the peak of change. Image after canny edge detection looks like these images.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/canny_image/whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/canny_image/solidYellowLeft.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/canny_image/solidYellowCurve2.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Region of Interest Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV provides `fillPoly()` function to define a polygon of given size and shape in a boundary. This function is used to apply a trianguar mask over image and only highlight the part of image which best fits the lane dimensions from image viewpoint given the lane has low gradient change.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/roi_image/whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/roi_image/solidYellowLeft.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/roi_image/solidYellowCurve2.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Hough Line Transform \n",
    "\n",
    "It takes a canny transform of image as input and draws solid lines marking the canny edges on it of desired pixel and returns it as hough transform of image. Here, a reduced canny image is passed as input assuming that the lines in the region of interest are lane lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/hough_transform_img/whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/hough_transform_img/solidYellowLeft.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    " <img src=\"test_images_output/hough_transform_img/solidYellowCurve2.jpg\" width=\"800\" alt=\"Combined Image\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Continuous Lane Marking\n",
    "\n",
    "`HoughLinesP()` returns an image with all the possible lines with given parameters and the coordinates of the lines as well. This data is used to make a mean left and right lane of a given thickness on image using slope intercepts of lines and extrapolating for a mean line out of all the lines based on their gradients (positive means right, negative means left). To avoid conditions of vanishing gradients still present in the processed feed, only lanes with gradients are marked on image.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Results on Video Feeds\n",
    "\n",
    "Video feeds for the 3 challenges given in the project are linked below. Drawing lines throughout snaps of the video wherever the pipeline returns a marked up image helps in creating lane lines on the video as a whole. This can be used for finding lane lines in an online fashion.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "[Challenge Video](./test_videos_output/challenge.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The pipeline can be used for detection of lane lines on a straight road very efficiently. However, it will prove inefficient on roads which are not so straight for example a street road pr a hilly road. The straight line will be formed by regressing a degree 1 polynomial so the lines may still form on such roads, but they will be a very bad estimate of lane lines. One of the reasons being the left bending lines on the right lane along a right turning road will be added to left lane category and thus regressor forming the lane will have wrong inputs for drawing the single thick lane lines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The pipeline can be used on fairly horizontal roads without gradient because the paramenters for selecting region of interest is a hard bound based on the fact that horizon in every image will be near the center of image. An image where road is sloping the pipeline may detect lane across a longer or shorter distance and with many anomalies based on various factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Light conditions plays a very important role in image processing for lane detection as colors are percieved variedly by the computer under a fairly different light availability which can be caused due to weather change, trees, shadows, diurnal change etc. Thus it gives computational power to identify lanes a very small share of all the conditional possibilities faced by human while driving, which is to say the pipeline will fail with change in light conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. What if there are no lane lines on the street! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic region selection based on gradient of road can be implemented to only keep lane lines in region of interest for the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Image can be divided in two halves and lane lines on each half can then be marked.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Advanced algorithms to deal with curves along the road should be implemented to make the pipeline more generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bird's eye view of the road can be generated to better understand the surrounding of the self driving car. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Advanced sensors and sensor fusion can be used to cover a large area of conditional states during driving a car. \n"
